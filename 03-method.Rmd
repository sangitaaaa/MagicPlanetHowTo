# Story/Presentation

Constructing a storyline for a spherical presentation can be different than creating a story for any other media. Visuals that would appear normally on a flat screen, when put on the sphere, tend to become distorted, resulting in a more limited range of visuals that can be used to accompany a story. It is important to keep that in mind while writing a narrative, because it becomes more efficient to cater the story to possible visuals, since the options are limited. 

Incorporate maps and visuals directly into the story. Verbally referring to maps or visuals in a written script, voice over, or presentation keeps it engaging for viewers and will help them interpret what is being shown on the screen.

Visuals do not necessarily have to be literal. Because of the limits on visuals that can be used on the spherical screen, itâ€™s important to be imaginative when it comes to visuals to aid your story. This is also an important concept to keep in mind if you do not have the ability to produce animation or other visuals specifically for the sphere.
